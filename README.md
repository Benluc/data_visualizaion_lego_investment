# data_visualizaion_lego_investment

The project is part of a bachelor thesis about the potential of interactive data visualization for decision-making in alternative investment opportunities. The example of lego investment was to find out to what extent visualization can help to gain insights from a large amount of data. The data presented was extracted from bricklink.com and brickset.com from June 4, 2018 to June 8, 2018. Due to data errors and missing data, the presented data represents approximately 25% of the total dataset of Lego Sets. The Lego sets shown are from the years 1966-2017. A point in the scatter plot and a complete line in the parallel coordinates represents a Lego Set.

For lack of data visualization experience, I opted for an explorative visualization approach to gain basic knowledge myself. The technical implementation is based to a large extent on the JavaScript library D3.js by Mike Bostock and should therefore be mentioned at this point. I hope the use of this tool is fun and leads to interesting insights.
